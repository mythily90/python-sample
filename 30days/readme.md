4: Largest element of an array
5: factorial
6: Trivial pgms like amstrong number, prime
7: Array slicing
8: Open file and print lines word by word and count number of lines
9. Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

Output: "fl"

Example 2:

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]

0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters
